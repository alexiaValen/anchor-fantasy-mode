# Anchor · Fantasy Mode 🌸💎

Anchor · Fantasy Mode is a **UI-first personal operating system** designed for people who wear many hats and need clarity without rigidity.

It blends:
- calm structure
- gentle–stern accountability
- somatic regulation
- playful, early-2000s inspired aesthetics

This project prioritizes **focus, follow-through, and nervous-system awareness** over traditional productivity pressure.

## ✨ Why Anchor Exists

When you:
- juggle multiple roles
- think faster than tools can keep up
- procrastinate because the scope feels too big
- lose ideas because they arrive at the wrong time

Most systems fail.

Anchor is designed to work *with* how the brain and body actually operate.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### Anchor
A grounding mechanism that limits the day to **three priorities only**.

### Fantasy Mode
A playful internal mode that allows creativity and softness *without sacrificing execution*.

### Bubble Brain
A judgment-free capture space for ideas, worries, and side quests — so they don’t derail focus.

### Somatic Instructions
Short, embodied cues that regulate effort and urgency:
- **Soften** → reduce intensity, keep direction
- **Unclench** → release tension before deciding
